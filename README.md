# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Task
This repository contains all files related to a data cleaning and preprocessing project undertaken to demonstrate common data preparation techniques.

# What I did
Created a raw dataset intentionally containing various data quality issues: missing values, duplicates, mixed data types, inconsistent text casing, and multiple date formats.
Performed data cleaning step-by-step using Python (Pandas):

Identified and handled missing values by removing incomplete rows or imputing where appropriate.

Removed duplicate records to avoid redundancy.

Standardized text values such as gender and country names to consistent, clean formats.

Converted all varied date formats into a uniform datetime type (ISO standard).

Renamed columns to lowercase with underscores for coding convenience.

Corrected data types (e.g., age to integer, dates to datetime) to ensure data integrity.

Saved the cleaned dataset as CSV for further analysis or reporting.

Included the Jupyter notebook used for this entire process, detailing each step with code and comments.

This approach ensures that raw, messy data is converted into a reliable, analysis-ready format. The repository also includes example datasets and the cleaning notebook to illustrate the workflow.

Sales Data Generation Task
This repository contains the Python script and generated dataset used for creating synthetic sales data.
# What I did
Used the Faker library to generate 5000 rows of realistic sales transactions.

Each record includes fields like Sale ID, Date, Customer Name, Product, Region, Quantity, Unit Price, Discount, and calculated Total Sales.

Designed the dataset to mimic real-world sales with variability in dates and discounts.

Saved the dataset as a CSV file for use in testing dashboards, practicing SQL querying, or modeling sales trends.

Provided the Python code used to generate this data, allowing customization for different sizes or product lists.
